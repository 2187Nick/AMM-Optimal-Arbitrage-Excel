# V2 to V2
When coding my arbitrage bot I had to build it in excel first. Old habit.
Thanks to https://github.com/paco0x/amm-arbitrageur for explaining the math.


Enter the reserves of 2 pairs and it will calculate the optimal amount to borrow and the profit.

(There is also a basic swap calculator to play with. Just enter AmountIn)
